Version: 0.0.1

Architecture: x86

This is a pretty hacked together operating system created from multiple sources and tutorials I have found. It is by no means working and has no real use yet but someday I hope to make that happen.

To compile, you will need an i686 toolchain + grub2 (MacOS/Linux only!) after run make macos/linux and make run (will ruin in QEMU)
